----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scrimba is an online training platform for people who have a passion for computer programming, and
Web development.

	Scrimba is a fun and fast way of learning to code! Their interactive courses and tutorials will teach you React, Vue, Angular, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and more.

	At Scrimba they use what they call Scrims which are editable screencasts.
	That allows you to change the code and see in real-time what it is you are trying to achieve.
