# Space-Exploration-Site---Scrimba

Folowing the tutorial by Scrimba and did some tweaks.
Stopped using Scrimba interactive course and use Vscode instead. 

<Known problem>
Button for some reason didn't have any clicking animation. It worked fine if deleted the background-image: url from CSS. 
  -Use the styling button to check if the button works.
  -Kept the styling.

Background image is low resolution.
