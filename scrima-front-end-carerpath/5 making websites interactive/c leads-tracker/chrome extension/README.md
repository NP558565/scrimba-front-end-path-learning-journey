Leads tracker is a chrome extension. You can use this to track leads on your browser. Lead tracking is the process of documenting and categorizing prospective customers based on individual actions and sales rep touches. 

It has three main functions:

1. Save Input - manually save URL
2. Save Tab - uses Google's `chrome.tabs` API to get current active window and active tab URL
3. Delete All - deletes all saved data
